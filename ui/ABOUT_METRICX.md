## The Problem With Ad Analytics Today

You know the drill.

Open Meta Ads Manager. Click. Click. Click. Click. Click. Click. Click. Click. Click. Click. Finally see your ROAS for one campaign. Now do it again for Google Ads. Now export both to a spreadsheet. Now spend 30 minutes figuring out which campaigns are actually making money.

**10 clicks before you see the data you need. 30 minutes before you can make a decision.**

This is insane. You're spending thousands on ads. You deserve better than tab-switching and spreadsheet gymnastics just to answer "what's working?"

## The Metricx Way

**1 question. 10 seconds. Done.**

Connect your ad accounts. Ask "which campaigns are profitable?" Get the answer. That's it.

No clicking through endless menus. No exporting CSVs. No building pivot tables. No wasted time.

Just ask:

- *"What's my ROAS this week?"*
- *"Which ad sets should I turn off?"*
- *"Where am I wasting money?"*
- *"Compare Meta vs Google performance this month"*
- *"What's my best performing creative?"*
- *"Show me everything with ROAS below 2x"*

The AI understands your campaigns, your metrics, your business. It gives you real answers, not dashboards full of charts you have to interpret yourself.

**What used to take 30 minutes now takes 10 seconds.**

## Why Merchants Switch to Metricx

### You'll Make Better Decisions

When you can ask any question and get an instant answer, you make smarter moves. You catch underperforming campaigns faster. You scale winners sooner. You stop wasting money on ads that don't convert.

**Better data access = better decisions = more profit.**

### You'll Save Hours Every Week

Stop spending your mornings in spreadsheets. Stop context-switching between ad platforms. Stop doing manual math to figure out true ROAS.

**Metricx gives you those hours back.** Spend them on creative, strategy, or actually living your life.

### You'll Finally See the Full Picture

Meta says one thing. Google says another. Shopify shows something different. Who's right?

Metricx unifies everything. One dashboard. One source of truth. Real numbers you can trust.

**No more guessing. No more conflicting reports. Just clarity.**

Check your campaigns from your phone. From the gym. From the coffee shop. No laptop required. No special setup. No proxies.

**Your ad performance, wherever you are.**

## Metricx vs The Competition

Let's be honest about what's out there.

### Triple Whale

Starts at $129/month. Built for enterprise brands with enterprise budgets. Overwhelming dashboards. Features you'll never use. Pricing that punishes growth.

**Metricx gives you the same insights for $29.99/month.** That's 77% less. Same results. More money in your pocket.

### Northbeam

$500+/month. Seriously? Unless you're doing millions in revenue, this makes no sense.

**Metricx delivers enterprise-level intelligence at a price that works for real businesses.**

### Spreadsheets and Manual Tracking

Free, sure. But what's your time worth? If you spend 30 minutes a day on reporting, that's 15+ hours a month. At any reasonable hourly rate, you're losing money doing it manually.

**Metricx costs less than one hour of your time per month. And it saves you 15+.**

### Native Ad Platform Dashboards

Meta Ads Manager. Google Ads. They show you data, but they don't show you insights. They don't connect the dots. They don't tell you what to do.

**Metricx doesn't just show you numbers. It tells you what they mean.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is Metricx different from Triple Whale?

Triple Whale costs $129+/month and was built for enterprise brands. Metricx delivers the same core insights—unified analytics, AI-powered queries, attribution tracking—for $29.99/month. We're faster to set up, easier to use, and dramatically more affordable.

### What ad platforms do you support?

Meta Ads (Facebook & Instagram) and Google Ads. Connect both and see unified performance across all your campaigns.

### Is my data secure?

Yes. We use secure OAuth connections (the same method used by every major platform). We never see or store your ad account passwords.
