Accepting this as inevitable is wrong. There are specific, actionable ways to reduce CAC without cutting the spend that's fueling your growth."

      "text": "Before optimizing CAC, break it down by channel. Your blended CAC (total spend / new customers) is useful as a north star, but it hides the fact that some channels might be delivering excellent CAC and others are dragging the average up. Pull CAC by Meta, Google, and any other paid channels separately. This almost always reveals at least one channel that's significantly underperforming — and that's where you start."

      "text": "CAC = Ad Spend / New Customers. You can reduce CAC by spending less or by getting more customers from the same spend. Getting more customers from the same spend means improving conversion rate — and most Shopify stores have significant room to improve. Review your product pages, checkout flow, mobile experience, and page speed. A 1% improvement in conversion rate on significant traffic can reduce CAC by 15-20%."

      "text": "High CAC often signals you're reaching the wrong people. On Meta, check your audience overlap — if your cold traffic and retargeting audiences are heavily overlapping, you're paying for the same impressions twice. On Google, review your search term reports for irrelevant queries eating budget. Both of these are common and fixable without reducing spend."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Also make sure you're excluding existing customers from acquisition campaigns. If you're paying to re-acquire someone who already bought from you, that purchase doesn't count as a new customer acquisition — but it does count against your CAC calculation."

      "text": "Better creative means higher click-through rates and more engaged traffic — both of which lower CAC. On Meta, your creative is the main variable you control. Test new hooks, formats, and angles regularly. When you find a creative that significantly outperforms your average CTR, analyze why and brief more content in that direction. A 50% improvement in CTR from creative testing alone can meaningfully reduce CAC."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Sometimes the right answer isn't to reduce CAC — it's to improve LTV so you can afford a higher CAC. If certain customer segments have significantly higher repeat purchase rates, you can profitably acquire them at a higher initial CAC because they're worth more over time. Identifying these segments and bidding more aggressively for them is often smarter than trying to drive down blended CAC across the board."
