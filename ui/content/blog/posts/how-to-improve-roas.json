      "text": "Before you can improve ROAS, you need to be measuring it correctly. Platform ROAS inside Meta or Google is a useful relative metric \u2014 good for comparing campaigns against each other \u2014 but your real target should be blended ROAS: total Shopify revenue divided by total ad spend. That's the number that tells you whether your advertising is actually profitable. These eight tactics are focused on improving that number."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "You can't improve ROAS without knowing what ROAS you need to be profitable. Calculate your break-even ROAS: 1 / gross margin. If your margin is 40%, break-even is 2.5x. If your margin is 60%, break-even is 1.67x. Every optimization decision should be measured against this floor \u2014 not an arbitrary industry benchmark."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The fastest way to improve average ROAS is to stop spending on things that aren't working. Most ad accounts have 20-30% of spend going to campaigns, ad sets, or ads that are consistently below break-even. Identify them, pause them, and redirect that budget to what's performing. This alone can meaningfully move your blended ROAS within a week."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "On Meta especially, creative quality is the biggest variable in ROAS. A better ad \u2014 one that stops the scroll, communicates value clearly, and makes someone want to click \u2014 will outperform a mediocre ad with the same budget every time. Test different hooks, formats, and angles systematically. Document what the top performers have in common and brief more content in that direction."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "ROAS is a function of both click cost and conversion rate. Improving your conversion rate improves ROAS without touching your ads at all. Review the product page or landing page your ads point to. Does it answer objections? Does it load fast on mobile? Is the CTA clear? Even small improvements \u2014 0.5% conversion rate increase \u2014 can have a significant impact on ROAS at scale."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "On Meta, broad targeting often outperforms narrow targeting thanks to algorithmic optimization \u2014 but that doesn't mean audience quality is irrelevant. Custom audiences built from your customer list, website visitors, or past purchasers typically convert at much higher rates than cold audiences. Make sure you're running retargeting campaigns alongside your cold traffic campaigns and measuring their contribution separately."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "ROAS = Revenue / Spend. If you can increase revenue per order without increasing spend, ROAS goes up. Bundles, upsells, cross-sells, and volume discounts all increase AOV. Even a 15% increase in average order value with the same ad spend moves ROAS significantly. This is one of the most underutilized levers in ecommerce advertising."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "If your product catalog has different margin levels, directing ad spend toward higher-margin SKUs improves your effective ROAS even when platform-reported ROAS stays the same. A sale that looks like 3x ROAS on a 60% margin product is far more profitable than 3x ROAS on a 20% margin product. Make sure your campaign structure reflects your margin structure."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "One of the most common ROAS improvement mistakes is optimizing for platform-reported ROAS rather than true business performance. If you're chasing Meta's attributed ROAS number without checking whether your Shopify revenue is actually growing proportionally, you might be optimizing for a metric that doesn't reflect reality."
