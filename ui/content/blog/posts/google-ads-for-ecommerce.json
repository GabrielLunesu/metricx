Meta is about creating demand \u2014 you're reaching people who weren't thinking about your product and making them want it. Google is about capturing demand \u2014 you're showing up when someone is already searching for what you sell. That distinction changes everything about how you structure, measure, and optimize your campaigns."

That's why Google Search and Shopping campaigns typically convert at much higher rates than social ads \u2014 you're not interrupting anyone, you're answering a question they're already asking."

For most Shopify stores, it's the recommended starting point. You provide the product feed, some creative assets, and a target ROAS \u2014 Google's algorithm figures out the rest. It's not perfect, but it's a fast way to get Google coverage with minimal setup complexity."

Brand Search campaigns \u2014 bidding on your own brand name \u2014 are almost always worth running to protect your branded traffic from competitors."

The best setup is the Shopify Google channel integration for basic tracking, combined with Google's Consent Mode and Enhanced Conversions for improved data accuracy under privacy restrictions."

Set your target ROAS above your break-even point but not so high that the campaign can't spend \u2014 if Google can't find enough traffic to hit your target, it just stops serving ads."
