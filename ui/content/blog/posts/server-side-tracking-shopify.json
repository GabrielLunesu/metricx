      "text": "If you're running Meta or Google ads on your Shopify store and relying on browser-based pixels alone, you're missing a significant portion of your conversions. Studies consistently show that browser pixels miss 30-40% of purchase events due to ad blockers, iOS privacy restrictions, and browser-level tracking prevention. Server-side tracking closes that gap \u2014 and it's more important now than it's ever been."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Traditional tracking works client-side: a piece of JavaScript code (the pixel) runs in the user's browser, detects a purchase event, and sends data back to Meta or Google. This depends entirely on the browser allowing the pixel to run \u2014 which increasingly, browsers and users don't."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Server-side tracking moves this process to your server (or Shopify's infrastructure). When a purchase happens, your server sends the event data directly to the platform's API \u2014 Meta's Conversions API (CAPI) or Google's Measurement Protocol \u2014 bypassing the browser entirely. Browser restrictions become irrelevant because the data never goes through the browser."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Three converging forces have made browser pixels unreliable. First, iOS 14's App Tracking Transparency framework: users who opt out of tracking have their browser-level activity hidden from ad platforms. With opt-in rates around 25%, the majority of iOS users are invisible to pixel tracking. Second, ad blockers: a significant percentage of desktop users run ad blockers that block pixel scripts entirely. Third, browser privacy defaults: Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention and Firefox's Enhanced Tracking Protection actively limit cross-site tracking."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The result is that for many Shopify stores, only 60-70% of actual purchases are being reported back to ad platforms via pixel. The algorithm is optimizing for an incomplete dataset, which means it's making suboptimal decisions about who to show your ads to."

      "text": "Shopify has native support for Meta's Conversions API through the Meta channel integration. In your Shopify admin, go to Sales Channels, find the Meta integration, and look for the Conversions API section. Shopify handles the server-side event sending automatically once you connect your Meta account and enable CAPI."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The best setup is redundant: run both the browser pixel and server-side CAPI together. Meta uses deduplication to avoid counting the same event twice, and having both sources means you capture events that the pixel misses and events that CAPI misses. This 'both channels' approach maximizes your event match quality score."

When a customer purchases, you send their hashed contact information alongside the conversion event. Google matches this against its user database to attribute conversions that the browser tag missed."

      "text": "After setting up server-side tracking, verify it's working by comparing your platform-reported conversions against actual Shopify orders. You should see an increase in reported conversions \u2014 typically 15-30% depending on how much your previous pixel was missing. In Meta, check your Event Match Quality score in Events Manager; it should improve significantly with CAPI enabled."
