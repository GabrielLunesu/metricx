For most Shopify stores running ads on Meta and Google, there's meaningful budget being wasted on campaigns, ad sets, or products that consistently underperform. Finding and eliminating that waste, then redirecting it to what's working, is the highest-leverage thing you can do without increasing your total budget."

      "text": "Pull the last 30 days of spend data across all your campaigns on Meta and Google. For each campaign, calculate cost per purchase and ROAS. Rank them from best to worst. You'll almost always find a clear pattern: a small number of campaigns driving the majority of profitable results, and a long tail of campaigns either breaking even or losing money."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "This is your starting point. The bottom 20-30% of campaigns by ROAS are your first targets. Before pausing anything, check whether they're in a learning phase (recent launch, recent changes) \u2014 learning phase underperformance is temporary and shouldn't trigger a pause. Established campaigns consistently below break-even should be paused."

Compare Meta-reported purchases and Google-reported purchases against your actual Shopify orders. If the numbers are dramatically different, fix the tracking first \u2014 otherwise you're optimizing against a fiction."

Don't dump all of it at once \u2014 increase winning campaigns by 20-30% at a time and monitor blended ROAS as you go. If blended ROAS stays strong, you've found a better home for the budget. If it drops, the winning campaign has hit its efficient spend ceiling and you need to look at other options."

Concentration of spend on your best creatives \u2014 rather than spreading it thinly across many \u2014 typically improves efficiency significantly. Most campaigns have one or two ads that account for 60-70% of conversions. Let them run."
