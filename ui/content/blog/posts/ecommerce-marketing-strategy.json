Run Meta ads, try Google, add an email sequence, test TikTok. There's no framework tying it together, no clear logic for how budget gets allocated, and no way to tell what's actually working. This post is the framework I use to build marketing systems that scale."

      "text": "Before you touch a single campaign, you need to know three numbers: your gross margin, your average order value, and your customer lifetime value. These determine how much you can afford to spend to acquire a customer and still be profitable. Gross margin tells you your break-even ROAS. AOV tells you the revenue per transaction. LTV tells you how much a customer is worth over time \u2014 which tells you how much you can afford to lose on the first purchase if they come back."

      "text": "Every ecommerce marketing strategy has three stages: acquisition (getting new people), conversion (turning visitors into buyers), and retention (getting buyers to come back). Most merchants over-invest in acquisition and under-invest in the other two. But improving conversion rates and retention dramatically improves the economics of acquisition \u2014 so you can afford to spend more per click."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Before scaling ad spend, make sure your conversion funnel is solid. That means a product page that sells, a checkout that doesn't leak, a post-purchase email sequence that encourages a second buy, and an offer structure that makes sense for your margins. Getting the funnel right first means every dollar you put into acquisition works harder."

      "text": "For most Shopify stores starting out, Meta is still the highest-leverage first channel. The targeting capabilities, creative formats, and audience scale give you the fastest feedback loop on what resonates. Start with broad targeting and let the algorithm find your buyers. Run 3-5 creative variations per ad set. Measure cost per purchase against your break-even CAC, not ROAS."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Once you have a profitable Meta setup, add Google Shopping. Shopping ads capture high-intent buyers who are already searching for what you sell \u2014 they convert better and often at lower CPCs than social. The two channels complement each other: Meta drives awareness and demand, Google captures it."

    {

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "A simple starting allocation for a store with a working Meta setup adding Google: 60-70% Meta, 30-40% Google. As Google proves itself, shift budget toward it proportionally. The goal is to find the channel mix that produces the best blended ROAS \u2014 not to optimize each channel independently."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Review budget allocation monthly, not weekly. Weekly fluctuations are noise. Monthly trends tell you something real. Look at blended ROAS by channel, not just platform-reported ROAS, and let actual Shopify revenue data guide where you shift spend."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Track blended ROAS as your north star. Track CAC by channel to understand acquisition efficiency. Track LTV cohorts monthly to see if customers acquired through different channels behave differently over time. These three metrics tell you nearly everything you need to know about whether your strategy is working."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The mistake most merchants make is relying entirely on platform dashboards for these numbers. Platform data is useful for campaign-level decisions within a channel. For overall strategy decisions, you need your actual Shopify data \u2014 real revenue, real orders, real customers \u2014 sitting alongside your spend data."
