**Last Updated:** November 7, 2025

## 1. Agreement to Terms

These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you and metricx ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") concerning your access to and use of the metricx platform and services.

By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our services.

## 2. Description of Services

metricx provides a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that enables users to:
- Connect and aggregate advertising data from multiple platforms (Google Ads, Meta Ads, etc.)
- Visualize advertising campaign performance through dashboards and analytics
- Query advertising data using natural language questions
- Generate insights and reports about advertising performance
- Track financial metrics and return on advertising spend

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the services at any time, with or without notice.

## 3. Eligibility and Account Registration

### 3.1 Eligibility
You must be at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into binding contracts. By using our services, you represent and warrant that you meet these requirements.

### 3.2 Account Registration
To use metricx, you must create an account by providing accurate and complete information. You agree to:
- Provide accurate, current, and complete registration information
- Maintain and update your information to keep it accurate and complete
- Maintain the security of your account credentials
- Notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to your account
- Accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account

### 3.3 Organization Accounts
If you create an account on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.

## 4. User Responsibilities and Conduct

You agree to use metricx in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You agree NOT to:
- Use the services for any illegal purpose or in violation of any laws
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the services or other users' accounts
- Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the services
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the platform
- Use automated systems (bots, scrapers) to access the services without authorization
- Upload or transmit viruses, malware, or other malicious code
- Violate the terms of service of connected advertising platforms
- Share or resell access to the services without authorization
- Remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices
- Use the services to compete with or create a similar product

## 5. Third-Party Platform Integrations

### 5.1 Advertising Platform Connections
metricx integrates with third-party advertising platforms (Google Ads, Meta Ads, etc.) via OAuth authorization. When you connect these platforms:
- You grant metricx permission to access data from those platforms as specified in OAuth consent screens
- You remain subject to the terms of service and privacy policies of those platforms
- You are responsible for maintaining valid authorization and compliance with platform policies
- We are not responsible for changes to third-party APIs or terms that affect functionality

### 5.2 Data Accuracy
While we strive for accuracy, metricx relies on data provided by third-party platforms. We do not guarantee that advertising metrics will exactly match platform native interfaces due to:
- API limitations and data sampling
- Timezone and currency conversion differences
- Data processing delays
- Attribution model variations

You should use platform native interfaces as the source of truth for billing and official reporting.

### 5.3 Revocation of Access
You may revoke metricx's access to your advertising platforms at any time through:
- The metricx platform (Settings → Connections → Disconnect)
- The respective platform's authorization management interface

Revoking access will prevent metricx from syncing new data but will not delete historical data unless you request deletion.

## 6. Intellectual Property Rights
