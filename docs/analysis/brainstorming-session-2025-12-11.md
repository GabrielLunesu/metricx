# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Gabriel
**Date:** 2025-12-11

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Product Hunt launch readiness for metricx - onboarding flow with AI-powered business context
**Goals:**
- Assess readiness for Product Hunt launch
- Design onboarding flow (user info, business info, domain)
- Build AI-powered context system for copilot personalization
- Set up "free until Jan 15" offer strategy

### Initial Ideas from Gabriel
- Collect user info + business info + domain during onboarding
- Analyze with AI to build merchant profile
- Feed context to copilot for personalized responses

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Product launch + product design + AI integration

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Question Storming:** Surface all sub-questions that define "launch ready" - creates comprehensive checklist
2. **Role Playing:** Design onboarding from multiple merchant perspectives - ensures real-world resonance
3. **First Principles Thinking:** Strip assumptions about AI context needs - maximize value, minimize friction

**AI Rationale:** Complex multi-dimensional challenge requiring foundation (what to solve), empathy (who we're solving for), and clarity (what's essential vs. nice-to-have)
